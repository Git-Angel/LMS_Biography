          <h1>About Myself</h1>
          <p>
            My name is Angelina Onuoha, from a small town in imo state, Nigeria.
            <br />
            I was born and brought up in Lagos state in a town that never
            sleeps. <br />
            Growing up amongst many siblings in a space where you cannot have
            all you <br />
            want, is quite a "bittersweet" experience now that I think about
            it.This <br />
            reflects the complexity of emotions tied to both loss and gain.What
            I do <br />
            now isn't what I grew up wanting to do, but I am glad I found Tech!
          </p>

          <p>
            Since I came into contact with technology and understood its
            potential for <br />
            automation and problem-solving, I have been eager to deepen my
            knowledge and <br />
            explore its vast possibilities. Witnessing how technology can
            streamline processes <br />
            and improve lives sparked a passion within me to become part of this
            ever-evolving field.
          </p>
        </section>
        <h1>Why I joined ALT school Africa.</h1>
        <p>
          joined the ALT School of Engineering program because I believe it
          provides the <br />
          perfect opportunity for me to acquire the advanced skills and
          knowledge necessary <br />
          to turn my enthusiasm for technology into meaningful contributions.
          The program's <br />
          emphasis on practical applications and innovation will help me
          envision creative <br />
          solutions that will address real-world challenges.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am excited to collaborate with like-minded peers to achieve this
          this.

            <br />

            <!--- Develop Core Competencies <br> -->
            Build a strong foundation in engineering principles, tools, and
            methodologies to <br />
            solve complex problems effectively. <br />
            <br />

            <!-- Engage in Hands-On Projects -->
            Participate in practical, team-based projects that simulate
            real-world challenges, <br />
            allowing me to apply theoretical knowledge and refine my technical
            skills. <br />
            <br />

            <!-- Contribute to Research and Innovation: -->
            Explore emerging technologies and contribute to research
            initiatives, particularly <br />
            in areas like renewable energy, automation, or sustainable design.
            <br />
            <br />

            <!-- Enhance Problem-Solving and Collaboration Skills:-->
            Work with peers from diverse backgrounds to tackle interdisciplinary
            challenges,<br />
            preparing me for the collaborative nature of engineering in industry
            settings. <br />
            <br />

            <!--Build a Professional Network: -->
            Connect with mentors, industry leaders, and fellow students to
