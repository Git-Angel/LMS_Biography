          <p>
            My name is Angelina Onuoha, from a small town in imo state, Nigeria.
            I was born and brought up in Lagos state in a town that never
            sleeps. Growing up amongst many siblings in a space where you cannot
            have all you want, is quite a "bittersweet" experience now that I
            think about it.This reflects the complexity of emotions tied to both
            loss and gain. What I do now isn't what I grew up wanting to do, but
            I am glad I found Tech! Since I came into contact with technology
            and understood its potential for automation and problem-solving, I
            have been eager to deepen my knowledge and explore its vast
            possibilities. Witnessing how technology can streamline processes
            and improve lives sparked a passion within me to become part of this
            ever-evolving field.

        <section class="why">
        <h1 class="whyy">Why I joined ALT school Africa</h1>
        <p>
          joined the ALT School of Engineering program because I believe it
          provides the
          perfect opportunity for me to acquire the advanced skills and
          knowledge necessary
          to turn my enthusiasm for technology into meaningful contributions.
          The program's
          emphasis on practical applications and innovation will help me
          envision creative
          solutions that will address real-world challenges.
          I am excited to collaborate with like-minded peers to achieve this
          this.
